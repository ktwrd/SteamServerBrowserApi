# v0.1 (31st Oct, 2025)

First working version! This project was created because the Web API for Steam can be a bit broken when it comes to searching for servers, so I made my own REST API for fetching this information (via the [SteamKit2](https://github.com/SteamRE/SteamKit) and [SteamQuery.NET](https://github.com/cemahseri/SteamQuery.NET) libraries).
